# Rotate Array

## Problem Statement
Rotate the given array to the left (counter-clockwise) by `d` steps, in-place. The array is circular, meaning elements shifted out from the start come to the end.

## Constraints
- 1 <= arr.size(), d <= 10^5
- 0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

## Example
**Input**
```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
d = 2
```
**Output**
```
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

**Input**
```
arr = [7, 3, 9, 1]
d = 9
```
**Output**
```
[3, 9, 1, 7]
```
